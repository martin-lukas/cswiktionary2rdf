# cswiktionary2rdf - Czech Wiktionary Extractor
This program extracts information from the Czech Wiktionary project into 
a machine-readable format RDF. For now it focuses on inflected forms of words.

Information being extracted:

* parts of speech (POS)
* declension, conjugation and degrees sections
* pronunciation
* gender and animacy

## Using the program
RDF-Wiktionary project enables extraction from unstructured data into a structured RDF format.

Available formats of RDF output are: ```RDF/XML```, ```Turtle``` and ```n-triples```.

You can choose the format by typing 
```<-x>/<-t>/<-n>``` 
respectively into the format argument.

There are several possible scenarion for running this program. 

They always start with ```cswiktionary2rdf.jar -jar```
1. Download the dump file from the internet into default download directory:
   - ```-d```

2. Download the dump file into a specified directory:
   - ```-d <dir path>```

3. Extract a specified dump file into a specified output file:
   - ```-e <format> <dump file> <output file>```

Example of the execution:

* ```cswiktionary2rdf.jar -jar -e -t dump.xml output.ttl```

For viewing this help again, use the parameter ```-h```.

## Example applications

The RDF dataset generated by this program can be used for various purposes:

- find missing or incorrect information on Wiktionary through SPARQL queries
- get semantics and context of a word (even through an inflected form of a word)
from the Czech DBpedia (through rdfs:seeAlso links generated from External Links section)
- search any word from Wiktionary pages, and get structured RDF data as a result

The third bullet point has been partially implemented in a web app
"Enhanced Wiktionar Search Enginey", which you can find at

https://martin-lukas.github.io/cswiktionary2rdf-tools/search.html

It lists all the pages where the desired word form appears, and if it 
appeared in one of the tables of inflected forms, it also gives a 
description of the form with its properties like case, number, gender and more.
